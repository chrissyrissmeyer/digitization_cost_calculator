    <h3>Processes to be performed</h3>
    <p>Below, enter information for each process for which you want time/cost estimates. Skip whichever processes you will not use. Enter a whole number to represent the percent of scans on which you plan to perform the process, and assign a staff person to the process using the "Performed by" drop down. Use the detailed information in the blue help button next to each process name for a brief definition and to understand what "% Materials" means for a specific process. For example, with "Flattening" the "% Material" represents the percent of scan source material that actually had to be flattened, not that was reviewed for flattening needs. With "Condition review" the "% Materials" is the percent of scan source material that is visually checked -- not the percent that needed conservation attention.
