## The project

The Digitization Cost Calculator is a project undertaken by the [Digital Library Federation Assessment Interest Group's working group on Cost Assessment](https://wiki.diglib.org/Assessment:Costs). The Cost Assessment working group's tasks are to aggregate and make freely available a large set of data on the time it takes to perform various tasks involved in the digitization process, in order to assist organizations in digitization project planning and benchmarking. To that end, we have collaborated with DLF to build the Digitization Cost Calculator and draft best practices and guidelines for the collection of time data for various digitization processes, with the goal of standardizing collection of such data in the field as well as to guide data submissions to the Digitization Cost Calculator.

How does it work? Users like yourself donate time data about various aspects of digitization. Each individual submission can be viewed on the Raw Data page. After submissions have been reviewed by the working group and approved, the calculator normalizes each contribution so it can be combined into an average with other contributions for the same digitization process. To use the calculator, you input parameters (including the cost of staff, the quantity of material you will digitize, and the level at which you plan to conduct different digitization processes, and which staff will conduct which processes) and the calculator will produce an estimate of time and costs for each process of your digitization project.

The calculator does not save, share, or transmit any data that you input.

When calculating the "cost" for a salaried staff person, the calculator takes assumes a 40 hour work week and 52 weeks to the year. So the cost for two hours of work would be (salary/(52x40))x2 plus benefits.
